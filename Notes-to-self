MVC - model view controller

The controller controls how the user interacts with the app and how the app gets information from the user.
The controller methods are mapped to specific URL and either send/receive get/post requests. Often get/post methods are paired together.
In each method, you must include a model variable, as the ModelMap is what stores the parameters that hold information that is entered
by the user or sent to the app/user. 
Each method in the controller returns as .jsp which controls how the information looks to the user.
Parameters from the website can be stored in the .jsp (to be sent to the user) but they must be stored in a model!

Question? Each method in the controller is executed when the user either browses to the mapped url, or clicks on a button that leads to
the mapped url. 

For each method, you should think to yourself - is the is a get, post, or do I need both? Remember, GET sends info to the app, POST gets info from the app


the redirect command direct to a url NOT to a view!
